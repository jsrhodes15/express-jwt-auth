## express-jwt-auth

Basic setup for JWT authentication using Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose

*you will need to add a `secrets.js` file that exports your secret string for jwt encoding.* [More info here](https://github.com/hokaccha/node-jwt-simple) 

#### planned improvements
[] Refactor DB connection for easy swap out
[] Genericize auth routes to be DB agnostic
[] Add unit/integration tests
[] Stand up light UI for easy testing
